## Notes on experiment reproduction.

The experiment reproduces the settings of Atashgahi et al. (2023) (https://openreview.net/forum?id=GcO6ugrLKp)

Required Steps:
1. Download the Datasets. Download links as well as the exact required file locations within experiments/data/ can be seen from experiments/utils.py
2. (optional) Test preprocessing (run_preprocessing.py). This can be used to check if the results for all features are equal to the "Baseline" results in Atashgahi et al. 
3. Execute run_main.py
